        This web applet simulates an ensemble of 5,000 electrons in GaAs at 300 K, in k space only (0D). This method is based on electron
        Monte Carlo method (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_methods_for_electron_transport">Wikipedia</a>). 
        The electrons drift classically under the electric field, but scatter quantum-mechanically with phonons (polar optical and
        intervalley). Scattering events are probabilistic, so random numbers are used (hence the name).
        The creation of this applet was inspired by the online <a href="https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/md/">Interactive Molecular Dynamics</a>.
        Hopefully, it can help students learning carrier transport and semiconductor physcis (as myself).

            <li>
                The first figure is a 2D projection of the 1st <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brillouin_zone">Brillouin zone</a>
                for FCC GaAs. The &Gamma; valley is at the center [000] and is spherical and populated at no field. As the field is increased,
                electrons gain kinetic energy and can scatter into satellite (L, X) valleys whose constant energy surface is ellipsoidal (hence
                their elongated appearance). By 2D projection, I mean that we plot k_y vs. k_x, regardless of k_z.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                    The second figure is the electron energy histogram (counts at energy), with the reference point as the bottom of the &Gamma; valley.
                    Note that at no field, the average energy is 1.5*k_B*T. As the electric field is increased, the energy distribution
                    broadens and electrons occupy the satellite valleys.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                    The third figure is the electron velocity histogram (counts at velocity). Study the average velocity as you increase the field. 
                    Due to the low mobility of the satellite valleys, you will observe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunn_diode">Gunn effect</a>.

        The program is written in JavaScript. You can see the code by inspecting the page source in your browser. (Warning: the code
        is ugly...this was an experiment!)
